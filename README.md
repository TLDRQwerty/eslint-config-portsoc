# eslint-confi-portsoc

A shareable config for ESLint.

```
Alice: "Other people's ESLint configs suck."
Bob:   "We should totes build our own."
Alice: "IKR?"
Bob:   "Hold my beer."
```

If you are submitting JS coursework, linting with this config should help you create code that's easy for your assesor to interpret.
